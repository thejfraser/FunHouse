#### How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
Elapsed Time: approximately 2 hours; given more time I would have refactored `App\Routines\SingleManning` further ShiftPattern could be an entire model itself

#### Why did you choose PHP as your main programming language?
For this task or in general?
 * For this task: its what im best at, and fit the requirements
 * In general: I fell into it in my first year at uni, whilst doing computer science we had a module on Databases and PHP, and it stuck from there.  Before PHP I was actually going towards Java.  I liked how easy it was to learn really, and then quickly moved into employment using it.

#### What is your favourite thing about your most familar PHP framework (Laravel / Symfony etc)?
My favourite framework has to be Laravel, the structural organisation is super neat and everything is in a place that makes sense.

Artisan is a big plus also, being able to make models and migrations in a single command is awesome.

Finally the models integrating with the database with very little modification is so much better than creating queries for everything.

#### What is your least favourite thing about the above framework?
Its not always the fastest of frameworks when uncached, and it can be database intensive when it comes to model querying
And lets not forget the version compatibility, thankfully Laravel Shift exists!
